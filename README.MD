## üìù Project Overview

This project is divided into three distinct business problems:

### **Problem 1: Predictive Shopping List for Monoprix**
* **Objective:** Develop a recommendation algorithm to suggest products that customers might have forgotten to add to their smart speaker-based shopping list.
* **Solution:** Proposed a hybrid, sequence-aware recommendation system combining Collaborative Filtering, sequence models (LSTM/Transformers), and Content-Based Filtering. Additionally, developed a scalable NLP pipeline to clean and standardize a messy product catalog using techniques like text normalization, semantic vectorization (Sentence-BERT), and unsupervised clustering (HDBSCAN).

### **Problem 2: Measuring Marketing Campaign Effectiveness**
* **Objective:** Advise a pharmaceutical company on how to measure the sales impact of a marketing campaign.
* **Solution:**
    * For an existing product with stable demand, a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** model was proposed to establish causal impact by comparing a treatment region with a control region, before and after the campaign.
    * For a new product launch, a **Cross-Sectional Regression with Control Variables** was proposed to measure the campaign's effect by controlling for regional confounders (demographics, market access, etc.).

### **Problem 3: Supermarket Salary Equality Analysis**
* **Objective:** Verify if a supermarket company's policy of non-discriminatory salaries based on employee location (Capital vs. Interior) is being followed.
* **Solution:** A multi-step analysis was performed using Python. This included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical testing (Mann-Whitney U). A **Multiple Linear Regression** model was built to control for confounding variables like job role, tenure, age, and education, ultimately isolating the effect of location on salary.
